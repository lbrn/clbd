      'Dr. Rangasamy is an Assistant Professor (Research) in the Department of Pathobiological and Center for Lung Biology and Disease at Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge. Dr. Rangasamy received his BSc, MSc, and PhD degrees from the University of Madras (India). He did his postdoctoral trainings at the Indian Institute of Science (Bangalore, India), Pierre et Marie Curie University (Paris, France), and Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore), and then worked as an Assistant Research Professor at the University of Rochester Medical Center, prior to his appointment at LSU in 2015. The overall goal of Dr. Rangasamy’s  research program is to identify the genetic mechanisms of susceptibility to oxidative stress related lung diseases such as cigarette smoke (CS)–mediated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), allergic asthma, bacterial pneumonia and septic shock. Our long term objectives are 1) to identify the host factors that determine the susceptibility to CS-induced COPD, allergic airway inflammation,  bacterial pneumonia, and acute lung injury and septic shock, using genetic, genomic, and proteomic methods which are especially valuable in the study of complex disease conditions, 2) to identify and characterize specific molecular pathways that are associated with COPD and asthma, 3) to investigate the role of the major anti-oxidative transcription factor Nrf2 in dendritic cell activation, T cell differentiation, and in stem cell differentiation, and 4) to develop small molecule/stem cell based therapeutic interventions in oxidative stress related lung diseases. Dr. Rangasamy has extensive expertise in mouse models of inflammatory lung diseases including CS-induced pulmonary emphysema, allergic asthma, bacterial pneumonia and endotoxin/cecal ligation and puncture mediated acute lung injury and septic shock; computer assisted lung morphometric measurements, measurement of lung elastance and resistance in asthmatic mice, isolation and characterization of mesenchymal stem cells from the lung and bone marrows, generation of myeloid dendritic cells/macrophages/neutrophils from bone marrows, differentiation of Th1/Th2/FOX P3 regulatory T cells, bacterial culture, extracellular and intracellular (opsonophagocytosis) bacterial killing assays, gene expression arrays (Affymetrix), expression (in E. coli) and purification (using FPLC) of recombinant proteins, development of contraceptive vaccine (mice rats and rabbits), epitope mapping, flow cyotometry, as well as in various immunological and molecular techniques. Dr. Rangasamy is currently working with Prof. Samithamby Jeyaseelan (Director, Center For Lung Biology and Disease). Dr. Rangasamy is investigating the therapeutic potential of prospectively purified lung mesenchymal stem cells in COPD (emphysema)-associated bacterial exacerbations, as well as in various infectious lung diseases including pneumonia caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pneumococcal pneumonia), and superbugs [methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and carbapenem resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae] using pre-clinical mouse models.',

Dr. Chen is a bacterial microbiologist with over ten years of experience in bacterial toxins, S. aureus pathogenesis, bacterial pathogen-host interactions, and glycobiology.  The main goal of Dr. Chen’s laboratory is to understand how S. aureus seamlessly transitions between infection and colonization.  S. aureus-associated pneumonia accounts for an estimated 50,000 staphylococcal infections per year in the United States.  Although S. aureus colonization (30% of humans) is strongly associated with higher risks for clinical infections, most colonized individuals will not experience S. aureus infections, suggesting that S. aureus maintains a dedicated balance with the host.  Neutrophils are the first host defense against S. aureus.  During pulmonary infection, the neutrophil influx is a double-edged sword: neutrophils clear the invading pathogens while overzealous neutrophils can cause tissue damage leading to pneumonia.  Dr. Chen’s current research seeks to understand the mechanisms by which S. aureus keeps lung neutrophils at rest, which is crucial to decipher how S. aureus transitions between silent colonization and infection.  Dr. Chen was awarded K12 Scholar, Translational GlycOmics Program for Career Development In Glycoscience by NIH/NHLBI (2020).
