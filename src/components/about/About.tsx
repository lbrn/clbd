            Welcome to the Louisiana Center for Lung Biology and Disease (CLBD)
            website. The Center was established in 2019 through an 11.6 million
            dollar grant from the National Institutes of Health-funded Centers
            of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE). The interdisciplinary
            faculty of the CLBD come from the Departments of Pathobiological
            Sciences and Comparative Biomedical Sciences at the School of
            Veterinary Medicine.

            The Center is committed to excellence in research and mentoring
            related to lung diseases. It is highly interactive, and consists of
            a dynamic group of junior investigators whose research focus is on
            understanding the molecular and cellular immunological mechanisms
            associated with the pathogenesis of infectious and non-infectious
            lung diseases using molecular, immunological, and pathological
            approaches in mouse models. They also use human samples to validate
            their findings from preclinical models.

            The research projects are supported by two scientific cores, the
            Pulmonary Immunopathology (PIP) Core and the Molecular Biology (MB)
            Core. The Administrative Core (AC) will coordinate the activities of
            the individual projects and cores, and includes a panel of mentors
            with outstanding experience in lung disease research.

            The Center has assembled senior scientists with outstanding track
            records to serve on the Internal Scientific and Advisory Committee
            (ISAC) and Mentoring Committee (MC) that carefully evaluate the
            scientific needs of each junior investigator and tailor the
            mentoring plan based on the individualâ€™s need. Senior scientists
            with exceptional track records are included in the external advisory
            board (EAB).

            sustainable, and nationally/internationally recognized Center of

            provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of devastating lung
            diseases that guide future improved strategies for treating and
            preventing these and other lung diseases in the human population.
